I know graduates who are currently:

## Adaptation in Stochastic [Research]{style="color:red;"} Environments {.smaller}

::: {.column-container}
::: {.column-left}
- **Bet-Hedging**
    - **Definition**: Increasing variance in fitness at the expense of lower average fitness to ensure survival across unpredictable conditions.
    - **Examples**: Plants producing seeds with staggered germination times.

- **Life History Adjustments**
    - **r-selection**: High fecundity with low parental investment (e.g., many offspring).
    - **K-selection**: Fewer offspring with higher investment (e.g., longevity, parental care).
    - **Dormancy**: Delayed development (e.g., seed banks).

::: {.column-right}
- **Boosting Genetic Diversity**
    - **Role**: Buffers populations against fluctuations, ensuring some individuals thrive in any condition.
    - **Mechanisms**: Variation of mutation rate, sexual reproduction, dispersal / gene flow.

- **Phenotypic Plasticity**
    - **Definition**: Non-parallel reaction norms among individuals with different genotypes in response to different environmental conditions. GxE interaction.
    - **Examples**: Seasonal coat color changes in animals; metabolic flexibility in plants.

## But what about being replaced by AI?

More importantly, an generative AI is a based on massively complicated statistical engines designed to answer the question, "what should I say next?"

## My advice
**Doing science beyond grad school involves**

1. Learn project management!
2. Leveraging your network
3. Looking to the future

**Useful tools**

- [Statistical Rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2024)
  
- [Project management with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/planning-and-tracking-work-for-your-team-or-project)
  
- [Learn git](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/04/25/new-zine--how-git-works-/)
  
- [Learn markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

## Advice from my friends

**Focus on transferrable skills like communication, technical writing, data viz, coding, problem solving.**

## Advice from my friends

1. Take a grant writing class
2. Take a coding class
3. Learn GIS, particularly if doing fieldwork
4. Take a 'how to find jobs seminar'


## Advice from my friends

•⁠  ⁠The best thing about SBS (and probably grad school anywhere) is the people. Make a point of meeting them, talking to them, asking for their help, and offering yours when you can. That will also have the side-effect of making you one of those great people folks meet in grad school.

•⁠  ⁠⁠From the day you come in to the day you leave, remember that you’re here to learn. Try stuff, fail, ask for help, change directions. Being bad at something is good. That’s just something you can try to improve at, which is why you’re here.

## Advice from my friends

1. Self-Evaluated Workload: Prioritize balance and adjust work hours based on personal assessment, not peer pressure or toxic "overwork" culture.

2. Critical Analysis: Always question why specific methods or techniques are used in research; avoid adopting approaches solely because they’re precedent—understand their rationale.

3. Workflow Investment: Develop and maintain efficient workflows tailored to your needs, even if it requires upfront time.

4. Advisor Relationship: Choose an advisor you can collaborate with effectively, as their mentorship profoundly impacts your PhD experience. Proactively nurture this relationship to navigate challenges.
