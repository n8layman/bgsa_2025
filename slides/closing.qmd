But it can sure feel like this getting into science right now right? For anyone colorblind I apologize - there are no overlapping colors between the legend and the diagram.

## For example

**Almost all of my academic friends, have all worked in both academic and non-academic environments at some point**

I know graduates who are currently:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Program manager 
- Database management
- Data librarian  
- Data scientist 
- Mathematical Statistician
:::

::: {.column}
- Researcher at the Smithsonian
- IT / AWS specialist
- Public health educator
- Consultant
- Environmental health professional
- Biotechnology startup researcher

- **Bet-Hedging**
    - **Definition**: Increasing variance in fitness at the expense of lower average fitness to ensure survival across unpredictable conditions.
    - **Examples**: Plants producing seeds with staggered germination times.

- **Life History Adjustments**
    - **r-selection**: High fecundity with low parental investment (e.g., many offspring).
    - **K-selection**: Fewer offspring with higher investment (e.g., longevity, parental care).
    - **Dormancy**: Delayed development (e.g., seed banks).

::: {.column-right}
- **Boosting Genetic Diversity**
    - **Role**: Buffers populations against fluctuations, ensuring some individuals thrive in any condition.
    - **Mechanisms**: Variation of mutation rate, sexual reproduction, dispersal / gene flow.

- **Phenotypic Plasticity**
    - **Definition**: Non-parallel reaction norms among individuals with different genotypes in response to different environmental conditions. GxE interaction.
    - **Examples**: Seasonal coat color changes in animals; metabolic flexibility in plants.

## But what about being replaced by AI? 

More importantly, an generative AI is a based on massively complicated statistical engines designed to answer the question, "what should I say next?"

## My advice
**Doing science beyond grad school involves**

1. Leveraging your network
2. Managing resources
3. Looking to the future

Why aren't you doing that now?
