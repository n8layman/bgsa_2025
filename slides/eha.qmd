Established in 1971, EcoHealth Alliance, then known as Wildlife Trust, is a global non-profit organization that uses rigorous and groundbreaking science to protect wildlife while safeguarding human health. We consist of a interdisciplinary team of scientists and scholarsâ€”from molecular biologists to field veterinarians, from bioinformaticians to behavioral risk specialists

The mission is to identify areas where human activity has increased the risk of zoonotic disease spillover, and the interventions necessary to prevent it.
