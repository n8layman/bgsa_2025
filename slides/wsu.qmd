In species where a range expansion has recently occurred, populations farther from the expansion's starting point accumulate are expected to accumulate more derived alleles. This is a result of the repeated bottlenecks associated with  This creates a spatial pattern where derived allele frequencies increase linearly with distance from the origin.
