I published two of my chapters in evolution and then went on to accept a post doc position later that year at the University of Idaho where I worked on the evolution of transmissible vaccines and got interested in disease forecasting. In 2021 I moved to my current position at EcoHealth alliance where I am currently a Senior Data Scientist.
