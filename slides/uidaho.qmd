We developed a weakly supervised machine
learning framework capable of segmentating land cover and classifying buildings using aerial photographs.

The idea was to use to combine these fine-scale resolution predictors with trapping data. That could let us use another machine learning technique, boosted regression trees, to identify where in the villages the zoonotic reservoir was most likely to be found. Which could be useful for coming up within mitigation strategies or evaluating the drivers of disease risk.

A few interesting things we found is that mastomys natalensis, at least in these three villages, tend to be found close to buildings. Less than 100 meters. The building type didn't seem to matter much. We also noticed an association with precipitation 5-6 months prior - something shown previously to result from birth pulses following the rainy season.
