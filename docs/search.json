Many of you here knew him but for those prospective students who didn’t that good fortune to meet him, he was a PI here at WSU but sadly passed away in 2023. His was an theoretical population geneticist and had a reputation for being tough. More than one of my fellow grad students warned me away from chosing him to be on my commitee during me first year. I am so grateful that I chose not to listen to that advice."
