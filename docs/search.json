Many of you here knew him but for those prospective students who didn’t that good fortune to meet him, he was a PI here at WSU but sadly passed away in 2023. He was a theoretical population geneticist and had a reputation for being tough. More than one of my fellow grad students warned me away from chosing him to be on my commitee during me first year. I am so grateful that I chose not to listen to that advice."

We then isolated 889 mutants from the evolution experiments and performed pooled fitness assays in all environments, plus five additional fluctuating environments. B-C After correcting for mean population fitness, we estimate a mutant’s fitness from the slope of its log frequency. D The null hypothesis of additive fitness in a fluctuating environment is represented by the average of the slopes in panels B-C. Non-additive fitness might result if transitions in the fluctuating environment alter fitness of a mutant. E Non-additivity can be visualized by plotting observed fitness in a fluctuating environment vs. the null hypothesis. Mutants with non-additive fitness will appear above or below the one-to-one line."

We then isolated 889 mutants from the evolution experiments and performed pooled fitness assays in all environments, plus five additional fluctuating environments. B-C After correcting for mean population fitness, we estimate a mutant’s fitness from the slope of its log frequency. D The null hypothesis of additive fitness in a fluctuating environment is represented by the average of the slopes in panels B-C. Non-additive fitness might result if transitions in the fluctuating environment alter fitness of a mutant. E Non-additivity can be visualized by plotting observed fitness in a fluctuating environment vs. the null hypothesis. Mutants with non-additive fitness will appear above or below the one-to-one line."
