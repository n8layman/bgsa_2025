As I understand it I have the honor, of which I am most definetly not worthy, of being the first Gomulkiewicz Keynote Speaker. Many of you here knew him but for those prospective students who didn't that good fortune to meet him, he was a PI here at WSU but sadly passed away in 2023. He was a theoretical population geneticist and had a reputation for being tough. More than one of my fellow grad students warned me away from chosing him to be on my commitee during me first year. I am so grateful that I chose not to listen to that advice.

Dick was not only an excellent scientist himself but also came from a long line of deep thinkers stretching back through Alan Hastings, Simon Levin and even all the way back in a direct line to Gauss. Once I graduated I worked as a postdoc in Scott Nuismers lab and from there went on to work with Dr. Noam Ross who was also trained by Alan Hastings. His loss is deeply felt.
